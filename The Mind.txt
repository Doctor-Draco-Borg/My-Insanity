Mind interactions and reality
The active mind generated from genetic disposition, hormones, experience, and habits generated from referencing subconscious.
The subconscious generated from quantum pattern synchronized and developed by the brains experiences. The fusion of these sides of consciousness, birth genius or better self
The quantum sink of subconscious can give you better insight into reality or things thought impossible through the conscious mind by allowing the conscious mind to accept, acknowledge, understand and interact with the subconscious can bring unexpected advantages.
The overwhelming nature of the subconscious usually prevents integration as well as the emotional imbalance caused by unknowns causes the conscious to separate or ignore it in most cases due to the preconceptions we've generated ourselves that are part of our active conscious breaking from the revelations of the unknown.
Those preconceptions is what usually causes the breakdown and builds the insanity and individuals who's experience proves to them? One of their preconceptions was not correct and ruins their current perceptions on reality via the revelation.

The best governments that have existed have a balance between government and religion due to the fact that a government has the best effect on conforming the active conscious whereas a religion has the best effect on conforming the subconscious of people based on the consensus of beliefs.
When in conjunction or balance can control a populous but when the balance shifts too far that's when it falls and one side flares up in the break which usually destroys both advancements.

Insanity stems from accepting as fact what you have not proven as fact cuz when it gets proven as not fact is when the breakdown occurs and the uncertainty it generates based on everything you've generated off. What you thought was fact builds to the blazing inferno of insanity that exists in your conscious mind.
